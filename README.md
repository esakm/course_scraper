# course_scraper
USAGE

This scraper only searches by semester. You need a database to store the data or you can rewrite the code to write to a file. 
Semesters needed go in semesters.json

You need the correct driver for the platform you're using and selenium/beautifulsoup 4. 

Eventually setup.py will be added. This is being used for another project.
